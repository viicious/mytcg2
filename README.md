# mytcg2

Working title, or something. mysql -> mysqli conversion of MyTCG (c) "Amanda", whoever that is.

-- Give users options and ways to do things, but not implement them (because I don't know PHP) (e.g. session_start() in header.php, login in sidebar, random event a la Gaia Online and Neopets, redirect after login, etc).
-- Include all those fucking hacks I found and how to install each one, but not implements (because I don't know PHP).
-- Starter pack of CSS themes, maybe. Bootstrap y/n?
-- ?????
-- Profit!
